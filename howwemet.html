		<h2>Leslie's Story</h2>
		<p>Starting my junior year of college I became quite involved with a black student ministry called the Impact Movement. This group strives to equip black students to become strong disciples of Jesus Christ and was a huge part of helping me grow into the young woman I am today. If you're on a university campus right now, you should definitely check it out.</p>

		<p>In October of 2016, there happened to be a retreat put on by Impact in Milwaukee, WI at New Testament church. I loved retreats, so this was something I was ready to go to. It was an excuse to leave the UW-Madison campus, hangout with friends, get spiritually refreshed, learn more about God, and help out the community. I was solely going to focus on God and was not at all trying to find a boy.</p>

		<p>So here's the thing, even though John wasn't a part of this group he ended up at the conference. New Testament was his family's home church at the time and his dad encouraged him and his sisters to go to this conference. John wasn't interested in going at first, but later changed his mind.</p>

		<p>The first day of the retreat was October 16th, 2016 . Students came in from all different universities, and got acquainted with one another. It was at this time when John first noticed me. John was playing some basketball at the other half of the gym, and was curious about the girl making a ton of noise on the volleyball court. That girl was me. I didn't notice his stares at this time, and was too focused on this volleyball game. Shortly after, my friends decided we wanted to switch it up and go to a different room that was set up with games. We all walked out, and John noticed.</p>

		<p>In the game room, it started off with some catch phrase, and some other game I can't remember. It was around this point that I looked in the doorway and saw some young looking guy come in. At this time, he was the only male in this room so he kind of stood out. In my head, I had been thinking, "I hope this guy knows how to have a fun time and doesn't ruin this atmosphere we've got going on". Shortly after this thought, I learned that his name was John, and he knew how to have a fun time and get people to laugh. This was a good sign. While in the game room, we decided to play the game Nertz, a competitive card game I had just learned how to play the previous summer. I boasted about being a good player, so when we all decided to play the game with partners, John who was conveniently standing beside me, decided it'd be a good idea to pair up.</p>

		<p>This was when I found out how fun it was to be around him. There was this chemistry between us that just seemed natural. It was as if I had known this guy for a long while before this. I was hoping in the back of my mind that this retreat wouldn't be the final time we got to hang out. My hope came true, and it definitely had not been the last.</p>

		<p>John and I have literally been talking every day since. He has been so intentional in this relationship, from day one. From friend, to best friend, to boyfriend, to fiancee, and now to soon to be husband . I know for a fact that God had his hands in this and can't express my gratitude for John. The relationship was never forced. Just came naturally. It was truly a set-up from God, and I wouldn't have wanted it any other way.</p>

		<h2>John's Story</h2>
		<p>Our first date happened on the worst possible day, a blizzard decided to come through Milwaukee. Leslie was staying with a friend of mine, Meghan, so I had to pick her up from Meghan's place in my broken Nissan Maxima. The plan was to go to Mayfair Mall and watch Star Wars Rogue One.</p>

		<p>I was super excited and super nervous at the same time. This was only the third time seeing each other in person and we weren’t officially a couple yet. I had to give the best first impression and make sure that a second date was going to happen. We got to the mall with plenty of time to spare before the start of the movie so we walked around and went into random stores, as I nervously tried not to give the impression that I was nervous. We went into the Lego store for a while and stacked random blocks together. We even ran into another friend of mine from Marquette, Gabby and her younger brother. I didn’t know how to introduce Leslie so I think I just said, “This is Leslie".</p>

		<p>While continuing our window shopping spree all I can think about is watching this Star Wars movie. Will it be good, will it not be good, will Leslie get bored? The most nerve racking question was when will I hold her hand?! I knew going into this movie I had to hold her hand at some point. It was hard to focus on the movie because I kept counting down to 10 trying to make myself grab that hand. I don’t remember exactly at what point I made the move but it sure felt good when I finally did. I could finally watch the movie in peace, and this was the beginning of one of my favorite pastimes, holding Leslie’s hand.</p>

		<p>After the romantic hand holding Star Wars filled night, we had to go back on the dangerous snow filled roads of Milwaukee. I still can’t believe we survived that drive. I couldn’t see at all and my wind shield wipers barely worked. I had to creep on the highway and it took forever to get back. Thankfully we did survive the drive and I survived the date. A few days later we made our relationship official, and the rest is history.</p>
